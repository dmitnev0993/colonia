                                                <h3>Who Do We Act For</h3>
                                                <p>We usually act on your behalf and in your interests in all matters. Sometimes, it may be more appropriate for us to access insurance or manage claims where we act as an agent of the insurer. If and when this situation arises we will explain and highlight this to you.</p>
                                                <h3>Our Services</h3>
                                                <p>We offer a range of services to assist you to protect your assets and guard against unexpected liabilities including reviewing and advising on your insurance needs, identifying risk factors to avoid claims and seeking competitive premium quotations.</p>
                                                <h3>Our Products</h3>
                                                <p>We can advise and arrange a broad range of insurances on your behalf including: Home Building and Contents, Private and Commercial Motor, Farm, Business Packages, Construction, Liability, Workers Compensation, Industrial and Professional covers.</p>
                                                <h3>Retail Clients</h3>
                                                <p>Under the Corporation Act 2001 (The Act) Retail Clients are provided with additional protection from other clients. The Act defines Retail Clients as: Individuals or a manufacturing business employing less than 100 people or any other business employing less than 20 people And that are purchasing the following types of insurance covers: Motor vehicle, home building, contents, personal and domestic, sickness/accident/travel, consumer credit and other classes as prescribed by regulations. Some of the information in this FSG only applies to Retail Clients and it is important that you understand if you are covered by the additional protection provided.</p>
                                                <h3>Retail Client Issues</h3>
                                                <p>Typically we only provide General Advice to our Retail Clients. General Advice does not take into account your particular needs and requirements and you should consider the appropriateness of this advice to your circumstances prior to acting upon it. We will provide you with a General Advice Warning in such cases. If you are a new Retail Client purchasing Personal Accident or Sickness insurance and obtain Personal Advice, that is, advice that takes into account your particular circumstances, we will give you a <b>Statement of Advice (SOA)</b>, that sets out the advice provided and the basis on which the advice is made and our remuneration should you purchase the product. For existing Retail Clients we may not provide an SOA but rather provide the advice to you verbally. In such cases you may request us to provide you with a Record of Advice (via phone or in writing) which we will provide to you within 28 days of such request. When you ask us to recommend an insurance policy for you, we will usually only consider the policies offered by the insurers or insurance providers that we deal with regularly. In giving you advice about the costs and terms of recommended polices we have not compared those policies to other policies available, other than from those insurers we deal with regularly.</p>
                                                <p>If we recommend the purchase of a particular financial product, we will also give you a <b>Product Disclosure Statement</b> at that time, which sets out details specific to that product and the key benefits and risks in purchasing the product.</p>
                                                <h3>What We Expect From You</h3>
                                                <p>To enable us to provide the right advice we need you to provide us with complete information about the risk(s) that you face and those that you want to be insured for. You should also tell us about any relevant changes as they occur so that we can review your insurance needs accordingly.</p>
                                                <h3>Personal Information</h3>
                                                <p>The Federal Privacy Act 2000 sets out standards for the collection and management of personal information. With your consent, we will only use your personal information for general insurance services.</p>
                                                <h3>Cooling Off Provisions</h3>
                                                <p>All retail products are subject to a 14 day ‘cooling off period’. This means that if you are not happy with the product, you have 14 days to withdraw from the contract at no cost to you.</p>
                                                <h2>IMPORTANT INFORMATION</h2>
                                                <h3>Duty of Disclosure</h3>
                                                <p>Before you enter into a contract of general insurance with an insurer, you have a duty, under the Insurance contracts Act 1984, to disclose to the insurer every matter that you know, or could possibly be expected to know, is relevant to the insurer’s decision whether to accept the risk of the insurance and, if so, on what terms. You have the same duty to disclose those matters to the insurer before you renew, extend, vary or reinstate a contract of general insurance.</p>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>Your duty however does not require disclosure of matter-</li>
                                                    <li>That diminishes the risk to be undertaken by the insurer</li>
                                                    <li>That is of common knowledge</li>
                                                    <li>That your insurer knows, or in the ordinary course of his business, ought to know</li>
                                                    <li>As to which compliance with your duty is waived by the insurer</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                <h3>Non Disclosure</h3>
                                                <p>If you fail to comply with your duty of disclosure, the insurer may be entitled to reduce his liability under the contract in respect of a claim or may cancel the contract.</p>
                                                <p>If your non-disclosure is fraudulent, the insurer may also have the option of avoiding the contract from its beginning.</p>
                                                <h3>New Business</h3>
                                                <p>We will endeavour to arrange interim cover for property or risk not currently insured when you supply full details of the property or risk and all information requiring disclosure to the insurer. A proposal will need to be completed by you and submitted to the insurer prior to expiry of the interim cover. It is the insured’s responsibility to ensure accuracy of all information supplied on the proposal prior to signing the document.</p>
                                                <p>The policy document issued by the insurer forms the agreement between you and the insurer. Upon receipt of this document we recommend to check the details thoroughly to ensure the cover meets your requirements.</p>
                                                <h3>Renewals</h3>
                                                <p>We will give at least fourteen days notice of expiry of general insurance policy cover administered by Colonial Financial Services Pty Ltd. We do not accept responsibility for policies not administered by Colonial Financial Services. We may automatically renew those policies being administered as per policy expiry details.</p>
                                                <h3>Policy Alteration/Endorsement</h3>
                                                <p>Please contact us should you require alteration to details of the insured property or risk. Your Duty of Disclosure requires details of relevant matters be disclosed to the insurer, which have not been previously disclosed. An invoice will be issued to confirm the alteration we have effected with the insurer.</p>
                                                <h3>Terms of Payment</h3>
                                                <p>When we arrange, renew or vary cover on your behalf, we will invoice you for the premium, statutory charges (e.g. stamp duty, fire services levies, GST, etc.) and our brokerage &amp;/or fees. Invoices must be paid by the expiry date or within fourteen (14) days of receipt, unless otherwise stated. The full amount is payable by you to us, including the premium and statutory charges and/or brokerage and/or fees.</p>
                                                <p>If a cover is cancelled before the expiry of the period of insurance, we will refund to you only the net return premium we received from the insurer. We will not refund any part of the brokerage we receive for arranging the cover. Fees may also be charged for the cancellation.</p>
