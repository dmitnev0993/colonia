This Privacy Policy describes our current policies and practices in relation to the handling and use of personal information.</p>
                                                <h2>What information do we collect, HOLD and how do we use it?</h2>

                                                <p>When a claim is made under an insurance policy, to enable us to assist in the claim process, we and our representatives and those of the insurer (including loss adjusters, investigators, medical advisers and lawyers) collect information about the claim, some of which may be personal information. We may collect the information from you or from third parties.</p>
                                                <p>We provide this information to the insurer and or their agents and those appointed to assist you in making a claim.

The insurance laws also require insured’s to provide all the information required by the end insurer to help them decide whether to insure you and on what terms.  Credit Providers also require specific information to help them assess any credit applications that we may facilitate on your behalf.</p>
