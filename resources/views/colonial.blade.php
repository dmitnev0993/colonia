                                                    </li><li>When you ask us to recommend an insurance policy for you, we will usually only consider the policies offered by the insurers or insurance providers that we deal with regularly. In giving you advice about the costs and terms of recommended polices we have not compared those policies to other policies available, other than from those insurers we deal with regularly.
                                                    </li><li>You have a duty to disclose all relevant information that may affect the policy insurers assessment of the risk and the associated premium that they will charge for the policy. This duty of disclosure includes your responsibility to notify us of any errors you notice in the documentation at any time before, during or after you accept our quote.</li></ul>
                                                <h3>Policy prices are subject to change</h3>
                                                <p>Please be aware that quoted prices may change within the period of your quote. This is due to Insurers' prices changing continually throughout the year. </p>
                                                <p>It is possible that you may receive a quote, and then a few hours later the price may change before you have purchased your policy. </p>
                                                <p>Despite our best efforts to update your quote before you pay for your policy, there will be occasions when you will be asked to pay an additional amount. This can be due to differences in the timing of the prices changes on the Insurers' system and Colonial Strata receiving notification from the Insurers. </p>
                                                <h3>Policy Processing Times</h3>
                                                <p>Although we attempt to complete the processing of your policy promptly, there are times that this will not be possible due to events outside our control, i.e. internet service unavailable, incorrect information supplied, mismatches with information provided etc. When these happen, we will make all attempts to contact you to keep you informed to the progress of your policy using your supplied email address or any other contact details provided by you. </p>
